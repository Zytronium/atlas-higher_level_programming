# Python - Classes and Objects

---
This project is all about python classes.

Classes are something I'm already pretty familiar with from when I did
mobile app development, but I actually never fully understood them.

Classes are kind of hard for me to explain at the time of writing this, so I might
add that later. 

An object is just an instance of a class. (instance meaning an individual thing,
or a single occurrence, rather than the entire class itself)

For example, if I have 4 cars of the same make and model at my car dealership,
that make and model would be the class, and each individual car would be
an object, each likely with its own different properties like color or
previous owner, which would be the object attributes. And the things that
are the same for all of them, like it's design, name, manufacture, etc.,
are the class attributes.
