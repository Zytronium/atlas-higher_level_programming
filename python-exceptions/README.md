# Python - Exceptions

---
This project is all about exceptions.

Exceptions are basically errors. This project is all
about handling them using `try:/except:/finally:`. There are many
types of exceptions, like division by zero, name error, index error,
stack overflow error (although it appears that one might not be in Python, at least not under that name), etc.
