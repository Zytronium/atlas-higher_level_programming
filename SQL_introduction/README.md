# SQL - Introduction

---
This project is all about SQL.

SQL is a language used for managing databases and making database queries.
SQL uses all-caps English keywords and an English-like syntax that should be
somewhat easy to understand compared to another programming language like
C or Java. In this project, we use a MySQL server to host the database.
