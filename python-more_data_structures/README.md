# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

---
This project is all about the Set and Dictionary unordered data structures.

Sets and Dictionaries are similar data structures similar to a hash table from C.
They have a key that corresponds to a value, like name (key) and phone number (value). (or something like that)
A set is created using brackets, like this: `myset = { 1, "two", 3.5, None, [4, 5, 'six'] }`
A dictionary can be created the same way, in which case, everything given will be the key, and the values will be 0 by default (I think).
But dictionaries are usually created with a `:` to indicate the value, like this: `mydict = { "one": 1, "2": "two, "free": None, "the answer to life the universe and everything": 4
