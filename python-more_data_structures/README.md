# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

---
This project is all about the Set and Dictionary unordered data structures.

Sets and Dictionaries are similar dta structures similar to a has table from C.
They have a key that corresponds to a value, like name (key) and phone number (value). (or something like that)
I will update this readme when I know more about these datatypes.
