# Python - import & modules

---
This project is all about python imports and modules.
Imports are like includes in C. They let you use stuff from modules, aka libraries.
Most languages I'm familiar use imports instead of something like includes.
Modules are the things you import, like libraries in C. They include stuff that you
can use in your code to help do stuff easier or do things you otherwise couldn't in pure Python.
Libraries/Modules can be stuff compiled from other languages, like Java, C, Assembly, or even made in pure binary code.
This is how they let you do things you otherwise couldn't in pure Python.
For example, in both C and Python (to my knowledge), it is impossible to sleep (create a delay)
without importing from a library/module.
