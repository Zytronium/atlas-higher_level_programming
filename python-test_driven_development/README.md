# Python - Test-driven development

---
This project is all about test-driven development. I guess.

I might fill this in with more detail later when I have worked more on this project and can go into more detail.
But if I had to guess, test-driven development is making sure you test your code
properly, making sure to test all edge cases. You should always test your code
extensively before you release your program. And always keep in mind that the
user isn't always going to use the program the way you expect.
