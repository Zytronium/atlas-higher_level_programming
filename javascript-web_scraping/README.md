# JavaScript - Web scraping

---
This project is all about JavaScript web scrapping.

Web scrapping is basically sending a request to a website and pulling data from
it. This can be via an API, or (to my knowledge) just data form a regular website.
Web scrapping should only be done if the website allows it, or you have permission.
Otherwise, it may be illegal. (Or so I'm told. I'm no legal expert)
