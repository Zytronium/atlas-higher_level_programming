# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

---
This project is all about the List and Tuple data structures.
Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after first being created,
while tuples cannot, but are faster. Tuples may be useful for something you might not want every changed, like coordinates on a map, or for large sets of numbers, like a phone book with no names (a dictionary would be better for a phone book WITH names)
Lists are created in this format: `list_of_any = [2, 3, "string", True, None, 7]`
Tuples are created in this format: `tuple_of_any = (2, 3, "string", False, None, 7)`
(The only difference is the use of `()`vs `[]`)
